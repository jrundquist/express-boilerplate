# express-boilerplate
This is a simple boilerplate for websites. It uses a simple addaptaion of the setup used on the courseshark wesbsite.



## Tech
* node.js - 0.8.14
* coffeescript - 1.3.3
* express - 3.0.5
* ejs - 0.8.0
* less - 1.3.0
* mongoose - 3.5.3
* Heroku hosting

## Install
Setup is dead simple. Just clone/fork/download this repo. Run:
```
npm install
heroku create
```
and you are good to go.

## Configuration
Any evironmental variables you may need to set up are to be put in the `.env` file located in the root directory. 

## Running
It is safest to run this application using the `foreman` environement runner provided by the Heroku toolbelt.
As a shortcut you may use `./run` to run the project. This requires nodemon to be installed either locally or globally. 

## Pieces

### Models
Mongoose models live in the `/models` directory. 
They are included into the app in the `app.models` object. 
This object will act as the container for all the models you create.


Model files export their Schema and a boot() function that accepts the `app` instance.
The model will bind itself to the `app.models` object in this function.

### Controllers
Controllers are included in from the `/controllers` directory. 
Each controller file should export an anonamous function that accepts the `app` variable. 
The function will then bind all the routes into that `app`.
